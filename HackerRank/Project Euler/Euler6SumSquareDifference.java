/*
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is ==> 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is ==> (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

Sample Input 0
a) 3
22, (1+2+3)*(1+2+3)-(1*1+2*2+3*3) = 36-14 = 22

b) 10
2640
